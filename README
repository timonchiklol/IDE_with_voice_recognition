Nothing is here but i have a joke:

Why did the programmer go broke?

Because he used up all his cache.

Then he tried to get a job as a baker, but he couldn’t handle the cookies.
He thought about becoming a musician, but couldn't deal with too many notes.
Finally, he tried dating… but he couldn’t commit — everything was still in beta.
Now he just sits in the dark.¯_(ツ)_/¯
